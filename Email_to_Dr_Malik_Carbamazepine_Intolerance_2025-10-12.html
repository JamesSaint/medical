      <p>Urgent Review – Carbamazepine Intolerance and Drug Sensitivity Pattern</p>
    </section>

      <p><strong>Dear Dr Malik,</strong></p>

<p>I wanted to document and formally report a clear adverse reaction to carbamazepine. After two 100 mg doses, I developed systemic itching (scalp, underarms, chest, groin), autonomic instability, blurred vision, and no pain relief.</p>

This mirrors my previous experiences with duloxetine, gabapentin, pregabalin, and amitriptyline,  each producing comparable autonomic and histaminic reactions for which I was often advised to take antihistamines such as Phenergan or Chlorphenamine, with only very marginal benefit.</p>

<p>On 11 Oct 2025, around 1 p.m., approximately 22 hours after my first dose, I experienced a severe autonomic episode: dizziness, fluctuating pulse (111 → 85 → 110 bpm), chest and left arm tightness, facial tingling, and a constricted sensation at the back of my head and spine.</p>
<p>On 12 Oct 2025, I awoke in the early hours with intense generalised pruritus. I contacted 111; an ambulance attended after about 2.5 hours. I had already taken chlorphenamine and cooled myself outside, which eased symptoms. Paramedics found stable vitals and a normal ECG (HR 100 bpm, PR 126 ms, QRS 91 ms, QTc 425 ms) and advised GP or neurology follow up.</p>

<p>Given this reproducible pattern of drug intolerance across several neuro active classes, I believe my system is reacting through an autonomic and mast cell mechanism, likely exacerbated by post vaccine neuro inflammatory sensitivity.</p>

<p>I am requesting:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Carbamazepine to be listed as an intolerant or adverse reaction in my record.</li>
  <li>Consideration of mast cell activation testing (tryptase, histamine, DAO).</li>
  <li>Pharmacogenomic profiling (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) prior to any further prescriptions.</li>
  <li>Discussion of Nabiximols (THC - CBD oromucosal spray) as the most viable treatment path. Given that these drug sensitivities have followed the AstraZeneca vaccination, I believe NHS support for this option is appropriate.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am not refusing treatment. I am asking for a path that my body can tolerate.</p>
<p>Please let me know how best to proceed and whether additional investigations can be arranged.</p>

<p>Kind regards, <br>
<strong>James Saint</strong></p>
