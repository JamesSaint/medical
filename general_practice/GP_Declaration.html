        <section class="section card-like">
            <p><strong>To my General Practitioner,</strong></p>
            <p>I’d like to be clear from the outset about how I engage with healthcare. My confidence in the current GP model is limited. I’ve seen too often how it defaults to quick prescriptions and guideline compliance, with little room for genuine investigation or personal accountability.</p>
            <p>I’m not here to challenge you personally, but to work in a way that respects both our time and integrity. I approach my health from an evidence-based yet holistic perspective, and I take full ownership of the decisions concerning my body. I ask that you treat me as an informed adult seeking partnership, not compliance.</p>
            <p>I value practitioners who think critically, ask questions, and are willing to consider physiological and environmental complexity, not just symptom management through medication.</p>
            <p>My position isn’t abstract; I have both first-hand and second-hand experience of the harms caused by overprescription, misdiagnosis, and the abdication of responsibility within the system. Those experiences have shaped how I approach healthcare, with vigilance, data, and personal accountability.</p>
            <p>I also recognise that you are a public servant, entrusted with the responsibility to act in the best interests of those you serve. I expect that duty to be honoured. I am not here to defer or perform compliance; I am here to collaborate intelligently in pursuit of truth and recovery. Ego, assumption, or unexamined protocol have no place in that process.</p>
            <p>I’m also aware that healthcare is evolving rapidly. With the speed at which AI and data-driven diagnostics are advancing, the traditional GP model is already becoming obsolete. Within a few short years, patients like me will be able to access more objective, personalised, and accountable insight than the current system has ever offered. I mention this not to be misinterpreted as a threat but as a reminder that curiosity, adaptability, and humility will soon matter more than credentials.</p>
            <p>If we can meet in that spirit, we’ll collaborate effectively. If not, I prefer to disengage early rather than waste either of our time.</p>
            <p><strong>Sincerely,</strong><br>James Saint</p>
