            <p>To: Dr&nbsp;Malik and MDT colleagues<br>
                Subject: Correlation request — subtle brainstem T2 observation and clinical picture</p>
            <p>Dear Dr&nbsp;Malik and MDT,</p>
            <p>Thank you for reviewing my case. I’m not a neurologist or radiologist; I’m a patient with a background in Machine Learning / AI pattern recognition. My intention here is not to diagnose, but to clearly present what I noticed on the axial T2 images and ask for your expert correlation.</p>

            <h2>Context</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>History includes a right cerebral infarct previously discussed.</li>
                <li>Ongoing left‑sided sensory symptoms and pain, with occipital involvement.</li>
                <li>Working hypothesis (per recent discussion): brainstem process could better account for the clinical picture than spinal cord involvement.</li>

            <h2>Observation (Axial T2)</h2>
            <p>On review of the axial T2 series, I noted a subtle focus of increased signal within the brainstem region on one slice. I fully appreciate this could be artefact, normal variation, or partial‑volume effect. I’m therefore requesting expert eyes on whether this finding is <em>consistent with</em> the evolving hypothesis.</p>

            <h2>Why I believe it merits correlation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The focal signal appears qualitatively brighter than adjacent parenchyma on that slice, without obvious mass effect.</li>
                <li>If real, its location could plausibly intersect pathways relevant to the left‑sided symptoms (to be confirmed by you).</li>
                <li>This aligns with the current clinical hypothesis that a small brainstem event could explain the presentation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note mb-0"><strong>Important:</strong> I recognise common pitfalls in this region (pulsation, flow, susceptibility, and partial volume). I’m explicitly asking for radiology correlation to confirm or exclude this as an artefact.</p>

            <h2>Specific requests to the MDT</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Please verify whether the subtle T2 focus seen in <em>Figure&nbsp;2</em> represents a true parenchymal signal change versus artefact.</li>
                <li>If helpful, correlate with <strong>DWI/ADC</strong> and <strong>FLAIR</strong> on the same level, and consider comparison with any prior brain MRIs for stability or evolution.</li>
                <li>Advise on whether a <strong>targeted brainstem protocol</strong> (thin‑slice axial, reduced EPI distortion DWI, and SWI as indicated) would be informative if ambiguity remains.</li>
                <li>Comment on concordance (or not) with the left‑sided symptoms and the previously noted right cerebral infarct.</li>

            <h2>Closing</h2>
            <p>I’m offering these observations in the spirit of collaboration. I’d appreciate your view on whether this subtle finding is <em>consistent with</em> the brainstem hypothesis, or more likely an artefact or normal variation. Thank you for your care and expertise.</p>
