                <strong>Subject:</strong> Correlation request — subtle brainstem T2 observation and clinical picture. <br>
                <strong>Date:</strong> 8 October 2025
            </p>
            <p>Dear Dr. Malik and MDT,</p>
            <p>Thank you very much for reviewing my case. I appreciate I’m not a clinician, but given my background in Machine Learning and pattern recognition, I’ve reviewed my scans to better understand the medical discussion. My intention is not to interpret findings but to clearly flag what appears to me as a possible area for expert correlation.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section card-like">
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>For clarity, here is the current clinical context as understood from the most recent consultation and imaging:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Original impression: <strong>right cerebellar infarct of uncertain cause</strong>, identified following acute onset of left-sided hemisensory neuropathic pain after the second <strong>AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Vascular work-up negative</strong>: CT angiogram and bubble echocardiogram ruled out paradoxical embolic source.</li>
                <li><strong>CSF clear</strong>: lumbar puncture showed no oligoclonal bands or inflammatory markers.</li>
                <li>Previous <strong>C5/6 cervical signal</strong> change on 1.5 T MRI is now viewed as <strong>non-reproducible</strong> on 3 T imaging and not supportive of active myelitis.</li>
                <li>Dr Malik’s current working diagnosis: a <strong>small, radiologically indiscernible right-sided brainstem stroke</strong> within the same arterial territory as the cerebellar infarct, likely explaining the persistent <strong>left-sided sensory disturbance and occipital pain</strong>.</li>
                <li>Given the <strong>temporal relationship to vaccination</strong> and absence of alternative vascular risk factors, a <strong>vaccine-related thromboembolic mechanism</strong> is regarded as more plausible than other causes.</li>
                <li><strong>Central post-stroke pain</strong> remains a leading explanation for ongoing neuropathic symptoms.</li>
                <li><strong>MDT review scheduled</strong> at Cromwell Hospital on <strong>5 November 2025</strong> for collective evaluation of the brainstem–cerebellar findings and treatment response.</li>
                <li><strong>Trial of Carbamazepine (Tegretol)</strong> initiated: 100 mg once daily for 2 weeks, increasing to 100 mg twice daily, to assess modulation of neuropathic pain prior to MDT feedback.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="section card-like">
            <h2>Observation (Axial T2)</h2>
            <p>On review of the axial T2 series, I noted a very subtle focus of increased signal within the brainstem region on one slice. I fully appreciate this may represent artefact, normal variation, or partial-volume effect, and I would be grateful for your expert correlation as to whether this might align with the current clinical hypothesis.</p>

            <h2>Why I believe it merits correlation</h2>
            <p>I’m including the following purely to explain why, as a patient, I felt it might warrant your expert review:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The focal signal appears qualitatively brighter than adjacent parenchyma on that slice, without obvious mass effect.</li>
                <li>If real, its location could plausibly intersect pathways relevant to the left-sided symptoms (to be confirmed by you).</li>
                <li>This aligns with the current clinical hypothesis that a small brainstem event could explain the presentation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note mb-0"><strong>Important:</strong> I recognise common pitfalls in this region (pulsation, flow, susceptibility, and partial volume). I’m explicitly asking for radiology correlation to confirm or exclude this as an artefact.</p>

        <section class="section card-like">
            <h2>Specific requests to the MDT</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Please verify whether the subtle T2 focus seen in <em>Figure&nbsp;2</em> represents a true parenchymal signal change versus artefact.</li>
                <li>If helpful, correlate with <strong>DWI/ADC</strong> and <strong>FLAIR</strong> on the same level, and consider comparison with any prior brain MRIs for stability or evolution.</li>
                <li>Advise on whether a <strong>targeted brainstem protocol</strong> (thin‑slice axial, reduced EPI distortion DWI, and SWI as indicated) would be informative if ambiguity remains.</li>
                <li>Comment on concordance (or not) with the left‑sided symptoms and the previously noted right cerebral infarct.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note mb-0">I completely understand the team’s workload, and my intention is only to support the ongoing diagnostic process by ensuring potential details aren’t missed.</p>

        <section class="section card-like">
            <h2>Closing</h2>
            <p>I’m offering these observations in the spirit of collaboration and transparency. I would be deeply grateful for your opinion on whether this subtle finding could plausibly fit the current brainstem hypothesis, or if it is more likely to represent an artefact or normal variation. Thank you very much for your continued care and multidisciplinary coordination.</p>

    <strong>Side and Pattern Note:</strong>
    Symptoms are predominantly left sided for sensory change and weakness, with cranial and occipital neuralgia features also left weighted.
