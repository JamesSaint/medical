                <strong>Subject:</strong> Correlation request — subtle brainstem T2 observation and clinical picture. <br>
                <strong>Date:</strong> 8 October 2025
            </p>
            <p>Dear Dr. Malik and MDT,</p>
            <p>Thank you very much for reviewing my case. I appreciate I’m not a clinician, but given my background in Machine Learning and pattern recognition, I’ve reviewed my scans to better understand the medical discussion. My intention is not to interpret findings but to clearly flag what appears to me as a possible area for expert correlation.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="section card-like">
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>For clarity, here is the current clinical context as understood from recent imaging and reviews:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial impression: <strong>right cerebellar infarct of uncertain cause</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Vascular work-up negative</strong> for embolic source (CT angiogram and bubble echocardiogram).</li>
                <li><strong>CSF clear</strong>: lumbar puncture showed no oligoclonal bands or inflammatory markers.</li>
                <li><strong>C5/6 cervical signal</strong> on earlier 1.5&nbsp;T MRI now considered <strong>equivocal</strong> for true cord pathology.</li>
                <li>Current working view: a <strong>small right-sided brainstem or cerebellar ischemic event</strong> best explains the persistent <strong>left-sided sensory symptoms and occipital pain</strong>.</li>
                <li><strong>Central post-stroke pain</strong> is considered a likely component of the symptom profile.</li>
                <li><strong>MDT radiology correlation pending</strong> for a subtle brainstem T2 focus; targeted brainstem MRI protocol may follow if required.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="section card-like">
            <h2>Observation (Axial T2)</h2>
            <p>On review of the axial T2 series, I noted a very subtle focus of increased signal within the brainstem region on one slice. I fully appreciate this may represent artefact, normal variation, or partial-volume effect, and I would be grateful for your expert correlation as to whether this might align with the current clinical hypothesis.</p>

            <h2>Why I believe it merits correlation</h2>
            <p>I’m including the following purely to explain why, as a patient, I felt it might warrant your expert review:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The focal signal appears qualitatively brighter than adjacent parenchyma on that slice, without obvious mass effect.</li>
                <li>If real, its location could plausibly intersect pathways relevant to the left-sided symptoms (to be confirmed by you).</li>
                <li>This aligns with the current clinical hypothesis that a small brainstem event could explain the presentation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note mb-0"><strong>Important:</strong> I recognise common pitfalls in this region (pulsation, flow, susceptibility, and partial volume). I’m explicitly asking for radiology correlation to confirm or exclude this as an artefact.</p>

        <section class="section card-like">
            <h2>Specific requests to the MDT</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Please verify whether the subtle T2 focus seen in <em>Figure&nbsp;2</em> represents a true parenchymal signal change versus artefact.</li>
                <li>If helpful, correlate with <strong>DWI/ADC</strong> and <strong>FLAIR</strong> on the same level, and consider comparison with any prior brain MRIs for stability or evolution.</li>
                <li>Advise on whether a <strong>targeted brainstem protocol</strong> (thin‑slice axial, reduced EPI distortion DWI, and SWI as indicated) would be informative if ambiguity remains.</li>
                <li>Comment on concordance (or not) with the left‑sided symptoms and the previously noted right cerebral infarct.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="note mb-0">I completely understand the team’s workload, and my intention is only to support the ongoing diagnostic process by ensuring potential details aren’t missed.</p>

        <section class="section card-like">
            <h2>Closing</h2>
            <p>I’m offering these observations in the spirit of collaboration and transparency. I would be deeply grateful for your opinion on whether this subtle finding could plausibly fit the current brainstem hypothesis, or if it is more likely to represent an artefact or normal variation. Thank you very much for your continued care and multidisciplinary coordination.</p>
