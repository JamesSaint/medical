      <p><strong>Dear Dr Malik,</strong></p>

      <p>Following our recent discussions regarding the likely central origin of my neuropathic symptoms, I have been exploring evidence-based treatment pathways for patients who do not tolerate, or gain limited benefit from, standard first-line options.</p>

      <p>Given the persistence of my left-sided neuropathic pain and sensory disturbance, and my poor tolerance of antidepressant and anticonvulsant agents, I would like to ask whether a trial of <strong>Nabiximols (Sativex&reg;)</strong> might be clinically appropriate.</p>

      <p>Nabiximols has a dual cannabinoid formulation: balanced THC and CBD in an oromucosal spray. This appears particularly relevant for central post-stroke and brainstem-related neuropathic pain, acting on both nociceptive modulation and neuroinflammatory pathways. While its UK licence covers multiple-sclerosis-related spasticity, the literature increasingly supports off-label use for other central neuropathic pain syndromes such as I am experiencing.</p>

      <p>A friend of ours working within the pharmaceutical industry (Sanofi, Switzerland) has highlighted Nabiximols as one of the more well-tolerated and low-dependency cannabinoid options currently in use, which reinforces my interest in exploring it under appropriate medical supervision.</p>

      <p>If you felt this clinically justified, I would appreciate your guidance on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Whether a short monitored trial could be arranged under your supervision or via a pain specialist within your network.</li>
        <li>Any formal criteria, consent, or funding routes required (AXA-supported).</li>
        <li>Appropriate starting and titration parameters.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I remain committed to a cautious, evidence-based approach and value your expertise in determining whether this may be a suitable next step.</p>

      <p><strong>Warm regards,<br>James Saint</strong></p>
