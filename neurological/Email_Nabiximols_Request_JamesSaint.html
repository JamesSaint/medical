                <strong>Date:</strong> 8 October 2025

            <p>
                This correspondence forms part of the ongoing multidisciplinary review of my neurological case led by <a href="https://www.circlehealthgroup.co.uk/consultants/omar-malik">Dr. Omar Malik at Mount Alvernia Hospital, Guildford</a></p>

        <section class="card-like">
            <p><strong>Dear Dr Malik,</strong></p>
            <p>Following our recent discussions regarding the likely central origin of my neuropathic symptoms, and in light of my ongoing left-sided pain and sensory disturbance, I have been exploring evidence-based options for patients who do not tolerate, or gain limited benefit from, standard first-line agents.</p>
            <p>Given my poor tolerance of antidepressant and anticonvulsant medication, I would like to ask whether a monitored trial of <strong>Nabiximols (Sativex&reg;)</strong> might be clinically appropriate. The balanced THC–CBD formulation appears relevant to central post-stroke or brainstem-related neuropathic pain, acting on both nociceptive modulation and neuroinflammatory pathways.</p>
            <p>While its UK licence currently covers multiple-sclerosis-related spasticity, published evidence increasingly supports cautious off-label use for other central neuropathic pain syndromes. I would value your guidance on whether this could be considered within my current management plan, particularly as part of the ongoing multidisciplinary review.</p>
            <p>If you felt this justified, I would greatly appreciate your advice on:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Whether a short monitored trial could be arranged under your supervision or via a pain specialist in your network</li>
                <li>Any formal criteria, consent, or funding routes required (including AXA support)</li>
                <li>Appropriate starting and titration parameters</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I fully appreciate the need for evidence-based prescribing and would approach this cautiously and collaboratively. My hope is to find an option that could improve quality of life and functional stability without recourse to higher-risk pharmacological agents.</p>
            <p>Thank you again for your care and ongoing consideration of my case.</p>
            <p><strong>Warm regards,<br>James Saint</strong></p>
