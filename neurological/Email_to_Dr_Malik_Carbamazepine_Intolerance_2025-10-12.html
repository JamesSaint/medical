      <p>Urgent Review – Carbamazepine Intolerance and Drug Sensitivity Pattern</p>
    </section>

<section class="card-like">
  <p><strong>Dear Dr Malik,</strong></p>

  <p>I wanted to document and formally report a clear adverse reaction to <strong>carbamazepine</strong>. After two 100&nbsp;mg doses, I developed systemic itching (scalp, underarms, chest, groin), autonomic instability, blurred vision, and no pain relief.</p>

  <p>This mirrors my previous experiences with <strong>duloxetine, gabapentin, pregabalin, and amitriptyline</strong>—each producing comparable autonomic and histaminic reactions for which I was often advised to take antihistamines such as Phenergan or Chlorphenamine, with only very marginal benefit. All of these medications have been tracked for <strong>scientific integrity</strong> and documentation purposes but consistently demonstrate physiological intolerance rather than non-compliance or psychological overlay.</p>

  <p>On <strong>11&nbsp;Oct&nbsp;2025</strong>, around 1&nbsp;p.m., approximately 22&nbsp;hours after my first dose, I experienced a severe autonomic episode: dizziness, fluctuating pulse (111&nbsp;→&nbsp;85&nbsp;→&nbsp;110&nbsp;bpm), chest and left-arm tightness, facial tingling, and a constricted sensation at the back of my head and spine.</p>

  <p>On <strong>12&nbsp;Oct&nbsp;2025</strong>, I awoke in the early hours with intense generalised pruritus. I contacted 111; an ambulance attended after about 2.5&nbsp;hours. I had already taken chlorphenamine and cooled myself outside, which eased symptoms. Paramedics found stable vitals and a normal ECG (HR&nbsp;100&nbsp;bpm, PR&nbsp;126&nbsp;ms, QRS&nbsp;91&nbsp;ms, QTc&nbsp;425&nbsp;ms) and advised GP or neurology follow-up.</p>

  <p>Given this reproducible pattern of drug intolerance across several neuro-active classes, I believe my system is reacting through an autonomic and mast-cell mechanism, likely exacerbated by post-vaccine neuro-inflammatory sensitivity.</p>

  <p>I am requesting:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Carbamazepine</strong> to be listed as an intolerant or adverse reaction in my record.</li>
    <li>Consideration of <strong>mast-cell activation testing</strong> (tryptase, histamine, DAO).</li>
    <li><strong>Pharmacogenomic profiling</strong> (CYP2D6 and CYP3A4) prior to any further prescriptions.</li>
    <li>Discussion of <strong>Nabiximols (THC–CBD oromucosal spray)</strong> as the most viable treatment path. Given that these drug sensitivities have followed the AstraZeneca vaccination, I believe NHS support for this option is appropriate.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>To date I have demonstrated clear intolerance to the antidepressant and anticonvulsant medications listed above. Their reproducible adverse pattern supports a biological mechanism rather than a psychosomatic one. I am documenting this for ongoing transparency and to guide a safe, evidence-based treatment plan.</p>

  <p>Given this pattern, I would like to ask whether a monitored trial of <strong>Nabiximols</strong> might now be clinically appropriate. The balanced THC–CBD formulation is relevant to central post-stroke or brainstem-related neuropathic pain, acting through both nociceptive modulation and neuro-inflammatory pathways.</p>

  <p>While its UK licence currently covers multiple-sclerosis-related spasticity, emerging evidence supports cautious off-label use in other central neuropathic pain syndromes. I would value your guidance on whether this could be incorporated within my current management plan and considered by the multidisciplinary team.</p>

  <p>If you feel this justified, I would greatly appreciate your advice on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>whether a short monitored trial could be arranged under your supervision or via a pain specialist in your network;</li>
    <li>any formal criteria, consent, or funding routes required (including AXA or NHS exceptional-case pathways); and</li>
    <li>appropriate starting and titration parameters.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I understand and support the need for evidence-based prescribing. My intention is to find a pharmacological option that provides measurable relief and functional stability without further triggering the autonomic or mast-cell reactions documented with previous agents.</p>

  <p>I am not refusing treatment; I am asking for a path that my body can tolerate. Please let me know how best to proceed and whether additional investigations can be arranged.</p>

  <p><strong>Kind regards,<br>James Saint</strong></p>

  <h2>Mast Cell Activation Differential & Further Investigations Requested</h2>

  <p>
    Following comprehensive autoimmune, infectious, and immunoglobulin screening, all of which returned negative or within reference range, a <strong>mast cell activation–mediated process</strong> remains a plausible untested contributor to the multisystem symptoms observed 
    (neuropathic pain, pruritus, flushing, and autonomic instability).
  </p>

  <p>
    Given the pattern of <strong>allergic-type reactions to multiple medications</strong> and autonomic dysregulation despite normal ANA, ENA, ANCA, 
    complement, and immunoglobulin profiles, it is reasonable to evaluate for <strong>Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)</strong> as part of the ongoing 
    differential.
  </p>

        <td>Urine (24-hour collection)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Chromogranin A</strong></td>
        <td>Optional marker for neuroendocrine activation overlap.</td>
        <td>Blood (serum)</td>

  <h3>Clinical Rationale</h3>
  <p>
    Mast cell activation may bridge immunological and neurological mechanisms, aligning with the presentation of 
    <strong>fluctuating neuropathic pain, pruritus, autonomic instability, drug hypersensitivity, and inflammatory reactivity</strong>. 
    These investigations would clarify whether mast-cell mediator release underlies, amplifies, or mimics autoimmune or neuro-inflammatory processes.
  </p>

  <h3>Request Summary</h3>
  <p>
    Kindly consider inclusion of these MCAS-specific mediator studies within the next diagnostic round or MDT review, 
    to provide a more complete immunoneuro-inflammatory profile and identify any treatable mast-cell–driven component.
