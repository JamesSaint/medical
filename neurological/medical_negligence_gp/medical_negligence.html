      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Between 2021 and 2024, under the care of Dr Hannah Morgan at Emsworth Medical (Emsworth Surgery, North Street, Emsworth), I reported episodic onset of left‐sided scalp/occipital pain, facial numbness, visual disturbance, and sensory changes in the jaw/collarbone region, beginning within 24 hours of my AstraZeneca vaccine in 2021.  
        Despite repeated presentations, no urgent neurological referral or imaging was initiated by the practice.

      <h2>Chronology of Missed Escalations</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>2021 (post-vaccine onset):</strong> Initial complaints of occipital burning pain and facial numbness were managed conservatively (analgesics, reassurance) without referral or further investigation.</li>
        <li><strong>2022–2024:</strong> Recurrent episodic neurological symptoms recorded in GP notes (pain, sensory disturbance, visual blurring), with no escalation to neurology, no request for MRI, and no consideration of vaccine-related pathology.</li>
        <li><strong>Early 2025:</strong> Symptoms worsened; left hemisensory neuropathic features became more consistent and functionally impairing. Still no GP referral to neurology.</li>
        <li><strong>April 2025:</strong> I obtained a private referral via Doctor Care Anywhere (bypassing primary care), which led to prompt neurology review, imaging, and diagnostic work-up revealing a cerebellar infarct and suspect myelitis.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Analysis of Breach of Duty</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The practice under Dr Morgan failed to respect **red‐flag neurology symptoms** (focal sensory loss, visual symptoms, unilateral pain distribution) by not initiating timely imaging or specialist referral.</li>
        <li>No documented consideration of **post-vaccine neurological injury**, despite the temporal onset and evolving symptom pattern consistent with known rare vaccine complications.</li>
        <li>The delay in diagnosis and appropriate investigation materially worsened neurological outcome, by prolonging untreated neuropathic injury and preventing earlier intervention.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card-like">
      <h2>Impact of the Breach</h2>
      <p>
        As a result of the delayed referral and mismanagement by Dr Morgan and Emsworth Medical, I endured prolonged neuropathic pain, significant functional impairment, and psychological distress.  
        I was compelled to seek private diagnostic pathways to secure proper neurological assessment.
