  <h2>Diagnostic Hypotheses</h2>

  <div class="diagnostic-block previous">
    <h3>Initial Hypothesis (July 2025)</h3>
    <p>
      Early imaging and clinical correlation suggested a <strong>right cerebellar infarct of uncertain cause</strong>.
      <strong>CT angiogram</strong> of the extracranial carotid/vertebral circulation and a <strong>bubble echocardiogram</strong>
      did <strong>not identify an embolic source</strong>. Lumbar puncture showed <strong>no oligoclonal bands</strong> or CSF inflammatory markers.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <strong>subtle C5/6 cervical cord signal change</strong> on the 1.5&nbsp;T study was interpreted as possible residual
      from prior <strong>myelitis</strong>, pending further correlation. Subsequent opinions have queried whether this represented
      true cord pathology or artefact/resolving change.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="diagnostic-block current">
    <h3>Current Working Hypothesis (September–November 2025)</h3>
    <p>
      The evolving picture favors a <strong>small right-sided brainstem or cerebellar ischemic event</strong> as the most
      plausible unifying explanation for the persistent <strong>left-sided sensory symptoms and occipital pain</strong>,
      with <strong>central post-stroke pain</strong> considered in the differential. On 3&nbsp;T review, no robust demyelinating
      process has been demonstrated; the earlier cervical finding is considered <strong>equivocal</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A subtle brainstem T2 focus has been <strong>flagged for MDT radiology correlation</strong> to exclude artefact and to
      assess concordance with clinical pathways (with targeted brainstem protocol/DWI-ADC/FLAIR comparison if indicated).
      <em>Vascular work-up to date remains negative for embolic source.</em>
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Temporal proximity to the <strong>AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccination</strong> has been noted in the history; this is recorded
      as <strong>temporal correlation only</strong>, without inference of causality pending specialist review.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="diagnostic-block next-steps">
    <h3>Planned / Ongoing Actions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MDT review</strong> of brainstem/cerebellar findings with correlation across sequences and prior studies.</li>
      <li>Consider <strong>targeted brainstem MRI protocol</strong> if ambiguity persists (thin axial, optimized DWI/ADC, SWI as needed).</li>
      <li>Symptom-led management pathway acknowledging possible <strong>central post-stroke pain</strong>.</li>
