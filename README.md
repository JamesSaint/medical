# James Saint — Medical Records Index

This repository hosts my personal medical notes, letters, timelines, and supporting evidence for ongoing neurological investigation and care. It is a living archive intended to make clinical review faster and clearer. Nothing here is medical advice.

- Speed up **MDT review** with direct links to images and summaries.

## Conventions

- **Dates:** `DD Month YYYY` (e.g., `17 September 2025`).
- **File naming:** short, descriptive, stable slugs. Avoid spaces where possible.
- **Figures:** include brief captions; state modality, sequence, and slice context if known.
- **Claims:** preference for **verifiable** statements and clear distinctions between:
  - Observation (what is visible)
  - Interpretation (what it might mean)
  - Request (what I am asking the clinician to do)
